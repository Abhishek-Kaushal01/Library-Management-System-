# 📚 Library Management System (DSA-Based in C++)

A simple console-based **Library Management System** developed in **C++** using core **Data Structures and Algorithms**. This project is intended for learning how real-world problems like library management can be solved using basic DSA principles such as vectors (dynamic arrays), linear search, and sorting algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📘 Add new books (ID, title, author)
- 🔍 Search books by **ID** or **Title**
- 📤 Issue a book to a student
- 📥 Return an issued book
- 📋 List all books sorted by title
- ❌ Delete a book by ID

---

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

- `vector<Book>` – dynamic storage for books
- Linear search – used for searching by ID or title
- Lambda with `std::sort()` – sort books alphabetically by title
- Basic OOP – structure and class design for `Book` and `Library`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **Interface:** Command-line (console based)
- **No external libraries or databases used**
